Multiclass Classification Benchmarking: 

Create a classification model:
that can accurately predict the WCBâ€™s final decision on what type of
injury (Claim Injury Type) should be given to a claim. To do that, the
WCB has provided labelled data with all claims assembled between
2020 and 2022. You will need to develop a consistent model
assessment strategy that will allow you to create and compare
different candidate models to find the most generalizable one.

1.Model Optimization: After selecting your best (or set of best) models,
you are encouraged to explore ways to improve their performance (e.g.
hyper-parameter tuning or pre-processing/feature selection
adjustments). You should compare the optimized model with your
previous models and discuss your findings.

2.Additional Insights: This project segment is open-ended, meaning you
can explore as many ideas as you desire (as long as you make them
explicit and understandable). Here are some possible suggestions:

3.Analyze and discuss the importance of the features for the different
values of the target variable.

a.Create an analytics interface that returns a prediction when new
inputs are given.

b.Create a model that predicts other variables ('WCB Decision' or
'Agreement Reached') and check whether using these variables as
features improves the performance of your models.
